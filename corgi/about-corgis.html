<h2>About Corgis</h2>
<p>Corgis can come in two different types - the Cardigan and the Pembroke. 
The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a cattle herding dog breed that originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales.
Pembroke Welsh Corgis have descended from the Spitz family of dogs. 
Cardigan Welsh Corgis on the other hand, descend from the Teckel family of dogs. This is the same family which also produced the Dachshund.</p>
<p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has ears that are pointed and do not flop over on the sides of their heads but are more "fox-like".
Not only should the ears seem that way, but the head also should also seem "fox-like" in shape and appearance.
Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from their Cardigan counterparts by being shorter in length, having smaller ears, and being slightly straighter of leg.
The Pembroke Welsh Corgi also has somewhat lighter markings. This is caused by changes in the thickness, length, and direction of hair growth.

Being a double-coated breed, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds heavily all year around, with peaks in the spring and autumn.
With regular brushing, their coat is fairly easy to maintain, as well as naturally water- and dirt repellent. 
Females are also known to shed while in heat.

Breed faults exist and should not be bred on purpose; such as corgis with a very long and thinner coat coming from a recessive gene[9] and red coats present with a bluish cast which have a diluted colour.</p>
